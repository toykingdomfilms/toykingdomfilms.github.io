                    First at 12:03, we eat in the restaurant. There are other people but, (when Sami is rude) they run away! So we decided eat there ourselves instead. It might be fun for us only, though. 
                    <br><br>
                    Then at 2:04, when go to rocky mountain. We roasted marshmallows on the campfire and did a short camping session.  We didn't walk there unlike usual because we might run out of time. Then, we take 4 pictures there. We've gone here 3 times before & it was so fun!
                    <br><br>
                    Next, we go to Fluttershy's Garden, and played one game there. There, we also did a bit of strolling. Taked only one ugly picture because of lighting conditions. But its fun! Went here two times, but, many other people also went here!
                    <br><br>
                    After that, we go to Tiffy National Park to do some snow activities. Sledding, Skiing, snow ball fighting, everything you could imagine! You see, we had lots of fun the we almost never go to the clubhouse! Theres a big fire that actually went off!! Taked 4!
                    <br><br>
                    Next, we go to do some bonding with the pets, but we also played with a kite and we saw an owl! We did not own it and ate lunch.
                    <br><br>
                    We did 4 wallpapers for dollhouse. We packed our things away. We also did a celebration! Then, we spend time in the clubhouse bonding, we played 3 games. We ate dinner (and some of us ate midnight snack and) prepared for bed. The next day, for the last time we said bye!  Then we ate snack packed our bag and go home.
