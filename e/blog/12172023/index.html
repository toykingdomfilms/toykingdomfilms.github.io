                    <h2>The Begginning</h2>
                    Hello guys, do you want to see a whole adventure that brings joy? Hi I am Cute Doggie and this is my pal Grace Tuzi. Today is the beginning of the adventure and you're invited. You'll be seeing our bravery and the things we gone through.
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn't even sunrise when I woke up and found a treasure map under my bed. <br><br>
                    "Looks like a new adventure is driving my curiosity again," I said. <br><br>
                    The map has drawings of different treasures sparkling in the treasure chest. <br><br>
                    "I think this is the beginning of my adventure." I didn't take a moment to think about it when the sun rises up. I had to eat breakfast. I pulled out my pajamas and went down stairs. A secret note was on the breakfast table. I read the note:
                    <br><br>
                    "Your adventure starts now! You can start discovering the water. Well it's up to you. Start your Adventure!"<br><br>
                    Hmm, I was thinking, a new adventure in the sea? Aha! Perfect, a treasure map! That will be a good start for a sea adventure.
                    <h2>Treasure Key</h2>
                    Finally, the day soon arrived when me and my pal will go for a sea adventure. You know how tough I sailed in the sea? The waves keep flopping over our boat. We had to be brave. It took some time to arrive in the island. In front of our eyes was that huge treasure chest waiting in the sand. 
                    <br><br>
                    "I got to get you now," I said hoping. I grabbed the chest and pulled it with a wink. Nothing happened. <br><br>
                    Grace Tuzi laughed. "No key? "<br><br>
                    "This gotta have a key." I knew this chest gotta have a key. So I grasped the shovel nearby and digged as fast as I can. 
                    <br><br>
                    "No clue for the key," I said after searching for long. When I was about to leave, a scream screeched my ear. <br><br>
                    It was Grace Tuzi yelling, "The key is waiting in the tree come get it!" <br><br>
                    We opened the chest and kept the coins. We sailed back home.
                    <h2>Charming Gems</h2>
                    Finally, the day soon arrived when me and (i'll finish this up soon)
