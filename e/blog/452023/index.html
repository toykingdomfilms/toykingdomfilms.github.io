                    My baby brother is in danger. Boo may not seem in danger. This is a image of Boo running away on the sidewalk. This image was token by the kidnapper. The person who find kidnapper ask to give any images if he took any pictures and this is the result. Boo was injured badly. He had marks of sharp mirrors, his asma became worse, and he was weak. But I am thankful he did not die. The kidnapper do take care of Boo but made him injured too. I've been worried because it took so long before I see Boo. Actually Boo was 6 months in that time. 7 months when we found him.
                    <br><br>
                    The person who found Boo took Boo to the orphanage. But as soon saw our post. He went to the orphanage showing the post. Before he chatted about Boo, he sent him in the hospital. Then after he feels well, he chatted he found Boo. That's why it might took long before we saw him. It took 10 days with the kidnapper, and 14 days in the hospital. Boo cried when he saw the kidnapper, the person who found him, and the mother who took care of him. Speaking of mother who took care of him it took 6 days before he discovered this was our child.
                    <br><br>
                    We finally saw him again and give thanks to the person who find Boo. And the kidnapper was in prison. Actually they might be days that you notice we skipped, actually those days are mysterious, but I actually think that those moments might be more moments with the kidnapper. This is why you should be thankful. I love my baby brother Boo.
