                    Thinking Monkey is an exploitable image macro meme featuring a monkey standing in front of a seaport looking up with his finger in the corner of his mouth, as though he is deep in thought or contemplating something. The photo of the monkey is often used in memes to joke about coming up with an idea or ruminating over something. The image was originally taken at the island of Gibraltar, a British territory off the coast of Spain, which is known for its population of Barbary macaques. The image was originally posted to DeviantArt by user anagw8 in late 2011, with a low-quality version of the meme making the rounds on Instagram, Twitter / X and TikTok after 2020.
